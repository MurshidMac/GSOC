# GSOC
Last Year I started participating in Gsoc which is awesome and gave me plus gives us lot of exposure to trending technologies 
out there in the world. 
So here I have included both my projects year for past years which I got some good experience while going through them and trying out my own solution, its great that I learnt a lot.
## 2016

 ## 2017
 * LibreHealth Cornestone.js html5 DICOM image viewer
 
 This is one. I personally consider as the best project which I have ever worked on. It uses angular to implement an interface for that uses the [Cornestone.js](https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone) library to trending medical imagery.
